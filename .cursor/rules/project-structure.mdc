# Project Structure

This is a comparison project between Create React App (CRA) and Rsbuild build outputs.

## Build Outputs

- **CRA builds**: Output to `build/` directory (created by [package.json](mdc:package.json) `react-scripts build`)
- **Rsbuild builds**:
  - `rsbuild-dist-1.4/` - Rsbuild 1.4 production build (from `src/index.js`)
  - `rsbuild-dist-1.5/` - Rsbuild 1.5 production build (from `src/index.js`)
  - `rsbuild-dist-1.5-index-2/` - Rsbuild 1.5 production build (from `src/index-2.js`)

## Source Files

- React source code is in `src/` directory:
  - `src/index.js` - Main entry point (default)
  - `src/index-2.js` - Alternative entry point for comparison
  - `src/App.js` - Main App component
- HTML templates:
  - `public/index.html` - CRA template
  - `public/rsbuild-template.html` - Rsbuild template

## Entry Points

The project has two entry points to compare build outputs:
- Primary: `src/index.js` - Standard React entry
- Alternative: `src/index-2.js` - Used for `rs:1.5:build:index-2` command

## Package Manager

- This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager
- Always use `pnpm` commands when adding dependencies or running builds
