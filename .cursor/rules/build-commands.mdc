# Build Commands

This project has scripts for both CRA and Rsbuild builds.

## Available Scripts (from [package.json](mdc:package.json))

### Create React App Commands
- `pnpm start` - Start CRA dev server
- `pnpm build` - Build with CRA to `build/` directory
- `pnpm test` - Run tests

### Rsbuild Commands

The project uses environment-based configuration with `--env-mode` flags to control builds.

- `pnpm rs:1.4:start` - Start Rsbuild 1.4 dev server (uses rsbuild-core-1.4)
- `pnpm rs:1.4:build` - Build with Rsbuild 1.4 to `rsbuild-dist-1.4/` directory
- `pnpm rs:1.5:start` - Start Rsbuild 1.5 dev server (uses rsbuild-core-1.5)
- `pnpm rs:1.5:build` - Build with Rsbuild 1.5 to `rsbuild-dist-1.5/` directory
- `pnpm rs:1.5:build:index-2` - Build with Rsbuild 1.5 using `src/index-2.js` to `rsbuild-dist-1.5-index-2/` directory
- `pnpm build:all` - Build all variants (CRA + both Rsbuild versions) in parallel

## Build Process

All Rsbuild commands use `node node_modules/rsbuild-core-X.Y/bin/rsbuild.js` with environment mode flags:
- Development: `--env-mode rsbuild.X.Y.development`
- Production: `--env-mode rsbuild.X.Y.production`

The config in [rsbuild.config.ts](mdc:rsbuild.config.ts) reads environment variables to determine the version and entry point.
